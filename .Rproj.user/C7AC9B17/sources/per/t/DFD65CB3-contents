Title: Conformal Random Forests for Response Surface Emulation
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Kellin Rumsey
Maintainer: Kellin Rumsey <knrumsey@lanl.gov>
Description: This package fits emulators (also known as surrogates or response surfaces) using conformal inference with random forests. 
    The conformal calibration is performed using out-of-bag samples from the forest, eliminating the need for a separate hold-out set.
